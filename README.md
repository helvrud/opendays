# Faculty Open Doors - Electrochemistry Demonstrations

## Overview
This repository showcases interactive and educational materials developed for the **Day of Open Doors** at our faculty. The project demonstrates fundamental electrochemical concepts through engaging models and experiments, including:

1. **Electric Double Layer (EDL) Model**: A conceptual visualization of the electric double layer.
2. **EDL Proof of Concept**: An experimental setup to illustrate the functionality of the electric double layer in practice.
3. **Copper Tree Growth**: A mesmerizing electrochemical demonstration using electrolysis in copper sulfate solution to grow a "copper tree."

## Features
- Detailed diagrams and models explaining the **electric double layer (EDL)**.
- Instructions for replicating the **EDL experimental setup** to observe its behavior in real time.
- A step-by-step guide for performing the **copper tree growth experiment** safely and effectively.

## Installation
